- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @giik
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working at a [mostly] software company based in the US (though I work from Europe).  My work has been mostly in high-performance backend, a lot of C++ and some Go.  Lately I've also been dabbing in various dialects of SQL.
- ðŸŒ± I use this place to collect little tidbits of interest to me, and possibly to others.
